# Network Management System

This repository contains a **Network Management System (NMS)** built with Python, designed to streamline network administration tasks like configuration management, interface monitoring, and backups. The system is tailored for managing routers, switches, and other network devices.

## Features

- **Device Login and Management**: Secure login via SSH for device interaction.
- **Backup and Restore**: Automated configuration backups and restoration processes.
- **Interface Scanning**: Scans and retrieves interface details from devices.
- **Alert System**: Proactively alerts administrators of network issues.
- **Templates and Configuration**: Customizable templates for device configuration.
- **Database Integration**: Includes an SQLite database for storing network-related data.
